construct a hashmap inorder node
takes O(n) space and O(n) time to construct
to retrive positions in O(1) time

Use DFS to construct the tree
traverse through the preorder list

recurse by constructing left and right end pointers for subtrees
push the pair into a stack in the DFS with the root
also takes O(n) space and O(n) time
