Construct 1sum and 2sum trees

1sum - max sum from root to leaf
2sum - max sum from leaf to leaf under given root

Can calculate (1sum, left/right) tree using DFS
or just a 1sum tree is enough

For 2sum, at each node, compare 2sums of children
to (left 1sum + right 1sum + node value),
update 2sume of node as such.
