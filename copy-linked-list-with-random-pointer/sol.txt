traverse and maintain
multiple hashmaps maybe?

index -> original
original -> index
index -> new
new -> index

or even reduce it to
original -> new
new -> original
so you get a bijection in O(n) space

first traversal
    value and next
    original -> index -> new

second traversal
    random
    random -> original -> index -> new
