add all the elements up

keep track of the bounds of k
kl and kh

start with
kh = max(array)
kl = 0
then each stack takes 1 hour

mean = (kh + kl) / 2
while not converged
    if mean is too fast
        set max to mean
    elif mean is too slow
        set min to mean

k = final mean 

calculating too fast/slow takes O(n) time
while loop takes O(logm) time

total - O(nlogm) time, O(1) space for kh, kl, mean
