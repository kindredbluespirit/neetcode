modify array in-place

traverse along the array

if you encounter num,
then arr[|num|] *= 1

if it's already negative, then num is the answer.

---------

bit mask

for each bit position from 1 to 32
if the numbers in the array of length n+1 contain more bits in this position
than in the collective numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the extra number has a bit here.

collect all theses bits and you get the number.

using fast and slow pointers, 
maybe we'll skip it for now
as I don't have a good reference
