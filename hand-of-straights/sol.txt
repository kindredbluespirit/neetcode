size of array must be a multiple of groupsize

simply sort the array? O(nlogn) time, O(n) space
Each element can repeat atmost once

maintain a freq map
using the smallest element in the sorted array,
construct one group.

traverse groupSize times through the sorted array
to find the smallest element of the next smallest group.

Continue until found.

-----------

or, in the sorted array
check freq map of every element

everytime freq goes up before the groupsize is fulfilled,
it means a new group starts. Count the number of groups. 

Need to maintain amount of each group traversed
and also if finished traversal or not in O(n) space.
