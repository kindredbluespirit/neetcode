Hashmap num -> node O(n)
Hashmap freq -> freqlist O(n)
num minfreq O(1)
num capacity O(1)

Each freq list is a doubly linked list

ops -
add
remove
get
put

put -
if element exists, move to higher freq bucket
    if minfreq bucket is empty, increment by 1
if not, add to freq 1 bucket
    if full capacity, remove lru element from minfreq
    set minfreq to 1

get -
if element doesn't exist -
    return null
else get value
    increment freq by 1
    if minfreq bucket is empty
        increment minfreq by 1
