default, nC2 combinations
iterate and maximize
O(n^2) time, O(1) space

---------

total water:
(d2 - d1) * min(h1, h2)

forward + reverse iterator pair again
move the iterator that points to the smaller bar inwards

min(h1, h2) goes up while (d2 - d1) goes down

there's an optimal balance in between

O(n) time, O(1) space
