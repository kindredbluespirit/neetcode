Order by increasing end times in a list
Each element in the list is (startTime, endTime, profit)

dynamic programming dp = [(0,0)]
dp[i] is the (endtime, max profit) for the first i jobs

iterate through the jobs
    get the index of dp of all jobs ending before job j starts
    insert (endtime, max(dpj + pj, dp[-1])) at the end of dp
