Traverse the array
Check if the numbers are present,
even if not together

Simultaneously check if these numbers
exist in triplets with the other two numbers
being <= the target numbers.

Otherwise, the merge will lose the other numbers.

Example -
target = [7, 6, 3]
7 is initially only present as [7, 8, 1]
Any merge ensures that 6 is lost.

Collect all such triplets and merge to get target.
