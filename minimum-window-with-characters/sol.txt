freq map can be an array of size 26 * 2 (uppercase and lowercase)
or use hash map as per hint 2

sliding window
grow = move the right end
shrink = move the left end

grow the sliding window on s until the freq maps match
for the sliding window and t

O(1) for lookups because there are atmost 26*2 unique characters

then shrink the sliding window until it just fits.

For each endpoint in the sliding window, we get the corresponding
start and length of sliding window/substring = end - start

If the end of s is reached without satisfying freqmap, return ""
