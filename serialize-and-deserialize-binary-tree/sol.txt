DFS to get the max height of the tree h

construct array of length ( 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^h-1 ) = 2^h - 1

BFS to fill the array, also need to keep track of the position.

If the current node is at i = 2^hi - 1 + j
where hi is the height,
then the children are at i1 = 2^(hi+1) - 1 + 2j
and i2 = 2^(hi+1) - 1 + 2j + 1

Deserialization is straightforward
