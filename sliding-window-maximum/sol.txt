max heap retrieves the max element in O(1) time,

heap contains (num, pos) tuples, compared using num

add the current element to the heap as the window moves

as the sliding window moves, 
while pos(max element) < start,
remove it

O(log n) time to add/remove element
O(n) space for the max heap
max heap can get bigger than the sliding window

O(n-k) = O(n) space for the array holding maxima

--------

python import heapq for minheap

invert sign for maxheap ops
