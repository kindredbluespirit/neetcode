forward and backward iterators

keep track of highest point so far and store it in the index
f[pi] = (pf, hf)
b[pi] = (pb, hb)

two passes - O(n) time, O(n) space

iterate forwards again
for each point,
    consider pf, pb
    rectangle area = (pb - pf) * min(hf, hb)
    water area = rectangle area - block area

    skip to pb (other points between pf and pb can be ignored)

one pass - O(n) time
